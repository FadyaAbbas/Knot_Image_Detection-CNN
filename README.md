# Knot_Image_Detection-CNN

The deep learning model uses a convolutional neural network (CNN). This model represents image recognition and detection to detect defective wood boards such as knots.

Image classification is the process of taking the input dataset photos and outputting a class as “healthy” or "Defective". the accuracy of this model is around 94% 

This project will be improved using YOLO and more training datasets.
